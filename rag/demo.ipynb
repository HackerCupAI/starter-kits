It involves indexing a large corpus of problems and solutions and then using a search algorithm to find the most similar problems and solutions. We will use the `bm25` algorithm to index the problems and solutions. However, it's important to note that two problems with similar wording - Such as `Alice` and `Bob` are not similar problems. A keyword search algorithm like BM25 might not be able to find similar problems and solutions based on the problem statement due to this limitation. \n",

Therefore, we will use the `bm25` algorithm to index the problems and solutions and then use our zero-shot agent to generate a solution for a given problem statement. Then we can look for similar problems and solutions using the generated solution by comparing the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the problems and solutions. This is a very simplistic approach and is not perfect by any means, but it's a good starting point.\n",
