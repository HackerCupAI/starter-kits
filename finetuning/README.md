# Finetuning starter kit

This code is built on the HuggingFace trainers and allows you to do any combination of:
- training/finetuning any Causal LM from the HF Model Hub on the Hackercup dataset
- evaluating on the same
- sampling n code generations from the model checkpoint
- running all generations on the sample input/output pairs, and choosing the highest scoring one to run the full input/output pairs

```
